# Set Solver

It's not a good idea to try to solve [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)). Currently it takes like 20 years of computation time to find all solutions (i didn't actually calculate the number of years, but it's probably quite big).

## Plans

I have plans to improve the program. If I just do some smart optimizations and multithread it, it might be fast enough to try to run on a computer cluster or something. If I get lucky.

## Install

- `git clone <url>`
- `cd SetSolver`
- `make`
  - make sure you have `make` installed
- `./a.out`
  - enjoy your computer dying until you put it out of its misery
